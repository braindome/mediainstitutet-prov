            <h2>The squat</h2>
            <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <h2>The Bench Press</h2>
            <p>The bench press, or chest press, is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.</p>

        <div class="side">
            <h2>The Deadlift</h2>
            <p>The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press. </p>
